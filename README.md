## The app can be summarized as follows:

-A Dashboard that provides a summary of the overall app via panels. For example: Summary of Calorie Counter shows x% daily goal, and y% consumed.

-Dashboard can only accessed if thereâ€™s user data in localstorage, otherwise it will force a dialog form to be filled out.

-Once the form is filled out, that data will power the rest of the components. For example, the Calorie Counter and Weight Tracker tab will power up via the initial user data, and further allow the user to input future data and see overall data visualization of progress.
